
	There are two classes of spells: Those that last for a while,
and those that don't.  In each of these classes are two further
distinctions: Spells that are meant for use in combat, and those that
aren't.

	Combat spells are flagged with a '*'.  These may or may not work,
depending on the relative levels of the spell caster and his target.  If
the opponent is a great deal more powerful than the Cleric, it is very
highly resistant to the latter's magicking.  The formula for spell
efficacy varies from spell to spell, and contains a random factor.

	Each spell is described briefly, and is labeled 'Combat,' if ap-
plicable.  In addition, each is labeled either 'Immediate' or 'Duration.'
The former do whatever it is that they do RIGHT NOW, while the latter's
effects take a little while to disperse.

	The next page contains the Spell Tables.  The four pages
following describe the spells themselves, one level per page.

			diameter with great rapidity, catching and destroying
			any attacking monster.
