VER 1.12
3/22/86

  This release of DND uses a different CLEAR-SCREEN routine to correct
a "flashing" problem experienced on some video boards.  The notice file
also contains information about printing MAPS.


VER 1.11
10/16/84

  This release of DND supplies the correct CLERIC.DOC file.


VER 1.10
4/5/84

  This release of DND corrects a problem with the PASCAL compiler that
improperly set the stack and heap on machines with 512K or more of usable
memory.

  In addition, the procedure that is used to time delays was changed to be
independent of the interrupt rate.  This change allows the game to properly
run on machines with different clock rates, like the Tandy 2000.
