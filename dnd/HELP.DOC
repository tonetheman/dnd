                            How to Get Started
                            ------------------


1) Type DIR at the DOS prompt to show you the files on the disk.
2) Look for a file that may tell you how to start up the program. Look for
   files with names such as READ.ME, [filename].DOC, MANUAL.[ext], that will
   most likely tell you how to begin.
3) To read the file you have chosen, enter: TYPE filename.ext  at the DOS 
   prompt. By entering TYPE and then the filename (then the enter key), the
   the file's text will then start scrolling on the screen for you to read.
4) In order to stop the screen, hit the "control" and "s" keys at the same
   time. To begin scrolling again, hit any key.
5) If you want to print the entire file, hit the "control" and "P" keys     
   BEFORE you start scrolling the file (e.g., TYPE filename.ext). After it
   has finished printing, hit the "control" and "P" keys to take the computer
   out of the print mode. If you want to print what is on the screen at the 
   time, stop the scrolling and hit the "print screen" key.
