creation.  They are mean and vicious and deranged beyond all imagination.  If
you insist upon entering, the following pages will give you some information
about the foes you may encounter.  My knowledge is by no means complete
however, and  the 'Monster Manual' by Gary Gygax might prove to be a valuable
source of additional information.

KOBOLD

  A dog faced, two legged creature approximately three feet tall.  They are
reasonably well armed, but never-the-less, are not too difficult to kill.


GOBLIN

  A short (four foot tall) creature with large forearms and hands.  Their
average intelligence and lack of special attacks or defenses makes them only
slightly more resistent a foe than the Kobold.


ORC

  This boar faced, upright creature is fierce.  They are of average size
(about six feet tall) but with long upper limbs.  They live for about forty
years.

DWARF

  The dwarf is a human looking creature.  Although only 4 or so feet tall,
they weigh no less than 150 pounds due to their stocky build.  They live 350
years on the average.


HARPIE

  Harpies have the bodies of vutures but the upper torsos and heads of women.
The touch or sound of a harpie is extremely difficult to resist.  They are of
average size.


TROLL

  Trolls are large (nine foot tall) creatures that know no fear.  Their
ability to regenerate makes them especially dangerous foes.

BUGBEAR

  The bugbear is approximately seven feet tall and is armed with an assorted
collection of mismatched weapons and armor.  They are dangerous foes however,
because of their clumsy manner disguises their lightening quickness.


DOPPLEGANGER

  These two-legged creatures have the ability to take on whatever shape they
choose.  In combat they typically will assume the appearance of their
opponent.  They are subject to neither SLEEP nor CHARM spells.


GHOUL

  Ghouls are "undead", once human creatures which feed on human and other
corpses.  They are uneffected by either SLEEP or CHARM spells.  The magic
circle of protection from evil keeps these monsters completely at bay.

MINOTAUR

  Minotaurs are large creatures having the head of a steer.  They are cunning
and have excellent senses.


OGRE

  Ogres are over nine feet tall with low intelligence.  Their great strength
makes them an able opponent.

GIANT

  The giant is a very large human-like creature of slow gait and questionable
intelligence.  Its great size and strength and its single-mindedness make it a
very dangerous creature in combat.

VAMPIRE

  The vampire is the most dreaded of the undead.  Their great strength is
derived from the blood of their victims.  SLEEP, CHARM, and HOLD spells have
no affect on them.


BALROG

  The balrog is a reptilian humanoid of exteremely large size.  They are
fierce in combat and are difficult to kill.


DRAGON

  The dragon is a winged snake-like creature of gigantic size.  Its scales
offer protection to all but magic weapons, and it is not often attacked by
anything in its right senses.
